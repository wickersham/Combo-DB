  learning a character, picking a game, developing fundamentals
</div>

  Some have advised new players to stick with only one game or one character. Though this may help keep a player focused, there is nothing wrong with trying all of the new characters and games.

  If you are having trouble picking a game to learn, think about the defining mechanics of each game and which tools you want to play with (and against). The first step



   If you are interested in learning your game a bit better, here are some general core mechanics to consider. <br>



   Whether you are trying to settle on a main game to improve at, trying to learn a character, or just want to learn your game better, here are some things to consider

  <ul>
    <li>Combo system</li>
    <p>Learning how to string moves together efficiently is the first step I take in learning a game, and you can usually learn this online before even playing for the first time (you will play better with this in mind). <em>then</em> find out how your character makes the most of the games mechanics</p>

    <li>Damage scaling</li>
    <p>Everyone likes big damage. To get big damage, you must first understand how damage scaling works in your game. In general, the longer your combo goes the less damage your hits will do, so shoot for big hits early when possible.</p>

    <li>Movement options</li>
    <p>Dashing, running, air-dashing, hops, hyper hops, flight, teleporting, grappling hook...ing, turning into a puddle? Don't forget divekicking! You get the idea. Know the game system's options. Know the character's options. Know which moves enable trickiness and shennanegans and know which moves have special properties like invincibility or armor.</p>

    <li>Meter gain, meter usage</li>
    <p>Some games have resource meters which you can spend on powered up attacks. It is important to know what you can do with your meter, and also all the ways to build it.</p>

    <li>Options while getting off of the ground or recovering</li>
    <p>Do you like having an invincible backdash or other options to get out of intense pressure? How about the option to delay your get-up, or get up more quickly to throw off the opponent's timing? The Tekken series has <a href="http://www.tekkenzaibatsu.com/tekkentag/system_gettingup.php">a lot of getup options</a></p>

    <li>Character archetypes</li>
    <p>How the traditional character archetypes (grappler, rushdown, keepaway, etc) are treated differs depending on the franchise. If you keep getting grabbed by Zangief, or rushed down by I-no a different play style or character switch may be in order. There are always weaknesses to exploit in the opponent character and player, but the best fighting game players are very good at covering them.</p>

    In the interest of fun, it is important to keep an open mind about these mechanics. <strong>Every game mechanic takes place within the context of many more complex systems</strong> and may not be comparable in every situation. There is a long list of game mechanics which began as bugs totally unintended by the developers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wft_9OjzmtI">happy little accidents</a> (as legend has it, combos started out as street fighter 2 bugs)

spacing

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNKMCOU9_Po&t=23s">novriltataki goes over basic space control</a> in fighting games.
There's a reason why spacing is always cited as a core fundamental concept for fighting games. The first thing you should learn with your character is how to cover certain ranges with either ground pokes or anti-airs. As you get better you will learn more about the uses for each move in the game, but when just starting out pick out a few attacks that cover common ranges for your character.

matchups

real opponents

finding online resources
It definately helps to find someone really good you like who streams or puts out youtube videos.
