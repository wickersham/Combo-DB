If you understand what the startup, active, and recovery frames of a move refers to, feel free to skip to the next section. 

To explain the difference between links and cancels, some basics of the game's technical mechanics must be conveyed. 

Traditionally, attacks in games are broken down into three states. An attack has startup before it is active, this is before it gains a hitbox thus the player is vulnerable. 

startup: 
The frame you press a button, your character enters startup frames. These frames are vulnerable and the player character has no damage-dealing hitboxes out yet.
Some attacks can be canceled out of startup. If mistimed, this can mess up some combos

active: 
The first frame your attack can hit the opponent is the player character's first active frame. These are usually only a few frames long and
Most attacks which can be canceled can be during the active frames. Sometimes on hit, sometimes on block, sometimes either. 

recovery:

Usually you cannot cancel a move's recovery into a normal or special, sometimes super is allowed though.

combo timing:

Basically there are a few types of timing when stringing attacks together

Attacks are canceled when the current move stops early, and a new move starts before the first recovers

If the first attack completes its animation before the next one starts, we say the attacks are linked.

This is often how you combo a special move into another special move, as is the case with Akuma's Light Tatsu into Goshoryuken in Street Fighter.

Tekken combos are a bit different. While Capcom fighting games and many of their derrivitives require you to cancel from the active frames,

In Namco games and Mortal Kombat most of the combos need to be input during the previous attack's startup frames.

These concepts can apply to other games as well, combos can be found in all kinds of action games.
