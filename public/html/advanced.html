<div>Why do <em>you</em> pilot eva?</div>
<div>At some point you may have asked yourself: why do I keep doing this? In playing games, learning new things, falling into old habits or just keeping on in life in general. Many individuals who want to learn more about themselves and the world look into why they love these games. Here are a few suggestions, but you may have your own better reason: </div>

<ul>
    <li>Dominating the opponent (winning)</li>
    <li>Doing cool stuff, swag combos</li>
    <li>Exploring a game's systems and mechanics</li>
    <li>Making a living. Sponsors and Tournament $$$</li>
    <li>Kick reason to the curb and do the impossible</li>
    <li>Dandyism</li>
</ul>

<div>There is no right or wrong reason, like in life we all must find our own motivation. It helps to learn what keeps you going, and I believe this can be an important step in a player's evolution. Also it's fine to get burnt out, frustrated, or bored once in a while, if you aren't having fun with a game don't play it. </div> <br>


<div>Personally I believe all of the guides in the world are not enough to move some players from the beginner level to the advanced. What it does take is lots of real match experience, sometimes with a variety of characters and games. From game to game, the intermediate/advanced levels of competetive play are almost always very different, but I will try and hit on a few key points and give some examples</div> <br>

<div>Hit Confirming</div>

<div>So you can hit your combo every time in training mode but you keep dropping it in a real match? This common problem stems from being comfortable in training when nothing is on the line, but not against a real opponent. It is important to use moves which give you enough time to adjust. If it is your turn to press buttons, don't think, press! And recognize asap if your opponent is getting hit, blocking, standing, crouching, in the air, or sometimes other options as well. All these factors and others (spacing, meter, damage vs oki), determine which moves you use to continue your combo.</div> <br>

<!-- <div>other sources:</div> -->

<div>To improve: lots of training modes allow you to set the dummy to random block. You have to decide on the fly whether to go into something safe on block or combo on hit. Watch match videos of top players if you are having trouble finding what moves to use. As you get more experienced with situations, landing combos will become easier.</div> <br>

<div>advanced movement options</div>

<div>Depending on game and character there may be many subtle mechanics that effect movement, and it is important to know them all. It all comes down to knowing the systems in and out. Can I super jump here? In KOF the answer is yes, In Guilty Gear yes (except Potemkin) in Street Fighter IV no (except C Viper and Ibuki). When I backdash am I airborne? It may depend on the character. Certain attacks can alter your trajectory, this can be very important especially in certain matchups. You get the idea. Knowing all your options is what it all comes down to, for offense or defense.</div> <br>

<div>To improve: This one is perfect for a no pressure training mode scenario. Just see what you can do running/flying/hopping circles around the screen. Get fringe hits with normals (or abnormals) and specials and then see how you can convert those hits into damage</div> <br>

<div>option selects</div>

<div>This term is defined as the following: Input something which the game can interpret differently depending on what is happening on screen. Let's say that throws are input with forward + heavy attack. If you are close, the player will respond to f+h by attempting a throw. Farther away though, the game will give you a heavy attack. One input covers two different options. This can be very useful depending on the situation. Another example is crouch teching in Street Fighter IV.</div> <br>

<div>To improve: usually you need a friend to help you test and find these, or the ability to record the training dummy. It can be hard to tell if they are working, and they are hard to spot in a real match.</div>

<div>frame traps</div>

<div>This is tricking your opponent into thinking he has time to retaliate with something like a quick (say 3-frame) jab but they don't because you leave them a 2-frame gap. If they fall for it you can score a counterhit and bigger damage! This requires you to know a little frame data (this is how fast all moves start up and recover. don't worry you don't need to memorize a ton). Exact numbers aren't as important as knowing which moves leave you advantageous and which ones are disadvantageous.</div><br>

<div>To improve: You can look these up online, or find them yourself. This can also be easier with a friend helping you, though you can use the training dummy record feature too. ++</div>

<div>matchup knowledge</div>
<div>At some point you may find yourself falling into the same habits without using much brainpower, or what we in the business call "autopilot". After learning how to play your character the next hurdle is learning the matchups, and then finally how to fight the human being on the other end. Once you are familiar with your character's options you may have to do some re-learning in the context of fighting certain characters. If you keep getting rushed down or blown up by grapplers you may want to retool how you fight those types of characters. </div>

<div>To improve: reading character forums helps, but there is no substitute for playing lots and lots of human (and good) players.</div>

<div>whiff punishing</div>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQQCan5oo90">Juicebox's explanation of footsies</a> runs down whiff punishing in SFIV. It is 48 minutes but full of gold. Pretend he is your dad giving you a lecture.
<div>A large part of "footsies" at the higher level is known as whiff punishing. This can really separate the good players from the great ones. Work on this if you want to get great.</div>

<ul>
    <li>Step 1: predict what attack the opponent will do next</li>
    <p>this can be easy or difficult, there are many relevant factors. Many players just do <em>that</em> move at <em>that</em> range, so pick up on their habits.</p>
    <li>Step 2: make that attack miss</li>
    <p>walk backward out of range or forward and poke them out of it</p>
    <li>Step 3: punish them with your stuff</li>
    <p>after their active frames run out they are vulnerable sticking their arm/leg/tenticle out. Now you bop em with your sweep, button, or combo </p>
    <li>NOTE: this is NOT a reaction, and may require practice for each specific scenario.</li>
</ul>
<div>To improve: when you find yourself correctly predicting your opponents it is time to record the training dummy doing the moves you see often. Get the timing and spacing down for walking back and find a move that hits them. Get creative. You can really show you're in their head! </div>


<div>conditioning and the metagame</div>

<div>Once you find yourself familiar with the systems of your game, if nothing within the game surprises you anymore and you know why things on screen are happening the next steps for your growth involves playing against lots of human opponents. Conditioning is getting in your opponont's head. Here are a few examples to help explain the mind games that can go on.</div>

<ul>
    <li>"Make them block low twice and the third time hit them with the overhead or throw"</li>
    <li>"<em>I</em> knew that <em>you</em> knew I was going to do <em>that</em> so I did <em>this</em> instead"</li>
    <li>"Make them think I am a nutty player but suddenly calm down at a key moment to, say, bait an uppercut"</li>
    <li>"I'll put this move in my back pocket. If it's not a threat to my opponent, they forget it is one of my tools and I can pull it out to win the round"</li>
</ul>

<div>These mind games are only the tip of the iceberg.

  There are innumerable things to keep in mind regarding high level fighting games, here are just a few key points to consider regarding the metagame. </div>

<ul>
    <li>The longer you play the same person, the more familiar you both are with each other's styles. In both short sets and long ones</li>
    <li>During long sets many smart players prefer to keep a few tricks up their sleeve, even if it means losing an early round or match</li>
    <li>Many players keep their new resets and mixups super secret and bust them out when it counts in tournament</li>
    <li>"The first round is data". How many times have you seen a top player lose the first match, win round 2 by a decent margin, then win an almost perfect round 3. Easy. Test stuff. Find out as early as you can what type of player you are up against</li>
    <li>The rule of three: ++</li>
</ul>

<div>To improve: again, play lots of human opponents. Experiment with the rule of 3 against different levels of experienced players.</div>

novril watch match videos and play in alternation

infiltration not practicing

if you continue to think critically, and are genuinely interested in improving, it will come. It may not all make sense now, but give it a year and you may be surprised at how far you have come

I remember hearing a poker player say something along the lines of "sometimes you have to look at your stack, see you are losing, and change nothing about how you are playing".
