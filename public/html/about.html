          This site was initially a project for a web design course to help me learn MEAN stack. The idea was to make it easy to look for combos that people are actually using, and easily filter out ones that no longer work. This came from my frustration in browsing combo threads that were years old and wiki pages that had outdated information on them.

          With SFV fresh I decided to add a quick guide-type component where I can keep track of everyone's gameplan as I improve. The site was meant as a tool for me, after all.

          I would love to add features like users, themes, sortable tables, editable pages and matchup notes. I have a long list. We will see how this works out...
