        <div id="description">Ah, the tried and true! The bread and butter, the Ryu special, the <em> "you don't even know how to do one cool combo? try this one." </em> Not as safe on block as it was in USFIV but the super part is hit-confirmable. Buffer the fireball if you are fishing with crouch MK and if it whiffs the fireball won't come out! magic! Don't get whiff-punished! And if you see a Ryu sticking his foot out all day fishing for this combo, whiff-punish that sucka!</div>
